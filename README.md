# Awesome-Pong
My very first project in game development created 2 years ago. It's a simple Pong game with added visual effects and features an AI oppenent. The reason I call it Awesome pong is for not-so "awesome" reasons. Other than it being more visually atractive than regular pong, this was just a fun project to show off to my friends.

This is extreamly unorganised and with many unused extra classes.
I uploaded this to show how my progression in programming and development as I upload more in the near future.
