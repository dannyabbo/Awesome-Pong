# Awesome-Pong
This is my very first game development project, created as my final project for AP Computer Science. It's a simple Pong game that includes visual effects and features an AI opponent. Although I named it Awesome Pong, it's not necessarily because it's exceptionally "awesome." Rather, it's more visually appealing than a regular Pong game, making it a fun project to showcase to my friends.

However, I must admit that this project lacks organization and contains several unused extra classes. I have uploaded it to demonstrate my progression in programming and development, with the intention of sharing more projects in the near future.
